## Hugo
This site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) which is a static site generator. Static sites don't do any server-side processing, and just serve raw HTML, CSS and client-side Javascript.

## Theme
The theme is [Tailbliss](https://tailbliss.netlify.app/) which is a really cool custom theme for Hugo!

## Github Pages
The site is deployed via GitHub pages at the default pages domain: [https://sjcastemcenter.github.io/website](https://sjcastemcenter.github.io/website). GitHub pages allows you to serve any public repo as a static site via a site generator (like Hugo) for free! The repo can be found at: [https://github.com/SJCAStemCenter/website](https://github.com/SJCAStemCenter/website).

## Todos
- [ ] Set the site up on a more professional domain, like: stemcenter.sjcawi.org
- [ ] Teach students how to write posts in markdown
