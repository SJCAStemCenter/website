# 3D Printer Rules
In order to ensure everyone gets access to make their prints on the 3D printer, everyone has a weekly allotment of 6 hours of printing. Your max balance caps out at 12 hours total, and you can't stack it week after week! This is to ensure that we have enough time to finish prints at the end of the school year.

# Links
The following are some helpful links for 3D printing:

# 3D Printer Information
When setting up Cura, you will need to provide information on the specs of the printers to be able to print from them. Here's some information on our printers:
- Make: Creality
- Model: Ender 3 V3 SE
- Build Volume: 220 x 220 x 250 mm

# Filament Information
## Filament Types
- PLA: All-around good filament
- PLA+: Like PLA, but slightly more structurally stable
- PETG: Stronger but less pliable than PLA
- TPU: Able to bend, kind of like rubber

## Filament Temperatures
When slicing, you will need to provide accurate temperatures based on the filament you want to use. You can sometimes vary these temperatures *slightly* (maybe 3 to 5 degrees Celsius at most). Higher temps means it will melt more; lower temps means it will melt less. This being said, it's usually not necessary to deviate from the suggested temperatures.

These are the suggested temperatures:
- PLA: 200°C Extruder, 50°C Bed
- PLA+: 210°C Extruder, 60°C Bed
- PETG: 240°C Extruder, 70°C Bed
- TPU: 230°C Extruder, 0°C Bed
